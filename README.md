Generative Python Transformers
Overview:
This project involves developing a generative model using the Transformer architecture in Python. It utilizes pre-trained models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.

Objectives:
Develop a generative model leveraging the Transformer architecture.
Explore various pre-trained models for text generation.
Evaluate the performance and quality of generated text.

Methodology:
Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of text for training and fine-tuning.

Model Selection:
Select a suitable pre-trained Transformer model, such as GPT-2 or BERT.

Fine-Tuning:
Train the model on the collected dataset to adapt it for specific tasks.

Text Generation:
Generate text based on input prompts and analyze the results.

Evaluation:
Assess the quality of generated text using metrics such as the BLEU score and human evaluation.

Conclusion:
This project highlights the effectiveness of generative Transformers in producing high-quality text. Future enhancements may include experimenting with different architectures and training techniques for further improvements.
